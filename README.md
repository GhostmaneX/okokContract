1. Go to your database and execute the following SQL command:

INSERT INTO `items` (`name`, `label`, `weight`) VALUES ('contract', 'Contract', 1);


2. To change the vehicle name that appears on the contract, navigate to the vehicle folder and open the file 'vehicles.meta', you should change the <gameName>.

Example:
<gameName>Nissan GT-R</gameName>
